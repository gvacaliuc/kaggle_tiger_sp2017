# Rice Kaggle Club: Team Tiger

Git Repo to hold notebooks / scripts for Team Tiger.

## Good Practices

To maintain a bit of order, let's go ahead and follow some good practices on here.  Please
try to keep your notebook and script names prefixed with your NetID, so we don't have any
weird git issues / don't know whose work it is.  If you'd like to go one step further and
branch off your work, even better.  To do that, one could do something like:  
```
$ git checkout -b MYNETID
```
where ```MYNETID``` is your NetID.
